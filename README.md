# HindiHandWritingRecognition
Will predict the outcome of the inputted letter.



                                   Project Description
Statement->Make a Convolutional Neural Network that can  recognize Hindi alphabets.
Dataset ->This is the DevanagriDataset and is available from Kaggle in csv file format.This dataset conatins handwritten pictures of handwritten hindi alphabets and digits.Its name is (data.csv).There are also two h5 files one (devnagri_model.h5) that contains the epoch no. of the best model and validation loss and the other one is (devnagri_refined.h5) that contains the model  .
Software ->I built this project using Spyder.It is available on Anaconda Navigator.I used it because Anaconda has direct packages available for python that can be directly installed.
Hardware ->All my results and computations are based on intel i5 processor,8gb Ram without external Gpu.
